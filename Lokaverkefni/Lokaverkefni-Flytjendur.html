	    	<img class="rsmynd" src="myndir/rs.jpg">
	    	<p class="rs">The Rolling Stones are an English rock band formed in London, England in 1962. The first stable line-up consisted of Brian Jones (guitar, harmonica), Mick Jagger (lead vocals), Keith Richards (guitar, backing vocals), Bill Wyman (bass), Charlie Watts (drums), and Ian Stewart (piano). Stewart was removed from the official line-up in 1963 but continued as a touring member until his death in 1985. Jones left the band less than a month before his death in 1969, having already been replaced by Mick Taylor, who remained until 1974. After Taylor left the band, Ronnie Wood took his place in 1975 and has been on guitar in tandem with Richards ever since. Following Wyman's departure in 1993, Darryl Jones joined as their touring bassist. Touring keyboardists for the band have been Nicky Hopkins (1967–1982), Ian McLagan (1978–1981), Billy Preston (through the mid-1970s) and Chuck Leavell (1982–present). The band was first led by Brian Jones, but after developing into the band's songwriters, Jagger and Richards assumed leadership when Jones was dealing with personal troubles and legal issues.</p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qEuV82GqQnE?rel=0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>

    		<p class="rs">Led Zeppelin were an English rock band formed in London in 1968. The group consisted of guitarist Jimmy Page, singer Robert Plant, bassist and keyboardist John Paul Jones, and drummer John Bonham. The band's heavy, guitar-driven sound has led them to be cited as one of the progenitors of heavy metal. Their style drew from a wide variety of influences, including blues, psychedelia, and folk music.

After changing their name from the New Yardbirds, Led Zeppelin signed a deal with Atlantic Records that afforded them considerable artistic freedom. Although the group were initially unpopular with critics, they achieved significant commercial success with albums such as Led Zeppelin (1969), Led Zeppelin II (1969), Led Zeppelin III (1970), Led Zeppelin IV (1971), Houses of the Holy (1973), Physical Graffiti (1975), Presence (1976) and In Through the Out Door (1979). Their fourth album, which features the song "Stairway to Heaven", is among the most popular and influential works in rock music, and it helped to secure the group's popularity. </p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yLarDhciHY0?rel=0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Dio was an American heavy metal band formed in 1982 and led by vocalist Ronnie James Dio, after he left Black Sabbath with intentions to form a new band with fellow former Black Sabbath member Vinny Appice, the band's drummer.[1] The name Dio was chosen because it made sense from a commercial standpoint, as the name was already well known at that time.

The band released ten studio albums and had numerous line-up changes over the years with Dio himself being the only constant member. Guitarists included Craig Goldy, Doug Aldrich, Vivian Campbell, Warren DeMartini [2] Tracy G, Jake E. Lee and Rowan Robertson.</p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EhGEGIBGLu8?rel=0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>
